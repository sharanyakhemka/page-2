    <!-- Main Content -->
    <div class="text" id="text1">
        <p id="one">Welcome to Lost in Between,</p>
        <p>world where the boundaries of communication blur, </p>
        <p>and the essence of meaning dances between languages, cultures, and time.</p>
        <p>"Lost in Between" is a journey through the intricate web of human communication, </p>
        <p>where meaning often shifts, evolves, or even disappears in the spaces between </p>
        <p>languages and forms of expression.</p>
        <p>Here, we explore the beauty and complexity of messages that transcend borders,</p>
        <p>yet sometimes get lost along the way.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s uncovering a deeper message in a painting or finding new emotion in a song,</p>
        <p>every interaction reveals how much is found—and lost—in translation.</p>
        <p>Ready to join the conversation?</p>
